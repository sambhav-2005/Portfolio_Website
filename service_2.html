            <p>
                In my role as a Web Developer, I bring websites to life by coding with a focus on performance and responsiveness. I ensure that each site adapts flawlessly to different screen sizes, delivering an optimal experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. My development process includes using clean, organized code to create fast-loading pages that meet industry standards. Iâ€™m skilled in both frontend and backend development, allowing me to build websites from scratch or optimize existing ones. Security, speed, and user satisfaction are my top priorities. With each project, I aim to create a stable and efficient online presence.
